# Contributing to pySPECRE
This project is in development and would benefit greatly from your contributions! This document outlines how to go about:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
This project uses Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## This Project Uses[ Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue a pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) that covers this project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Gitlab's Issues
We use Gitlab issues to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Ideally, every bug report should have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - A minimum working example of code that reproduces the issue
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## ***Use a Consistent Coding Style***

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Lines should remain 79 characters or less wherever possible
* You can try running `black -l 79` for style unification
* The use of `pre-commit` hooks is required and instructions are provided in `README.rst`. These will automatically format and lint code to ensure proper formatting.
